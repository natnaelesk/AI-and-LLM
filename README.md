# 🧠 AI & LLM Experiments

Messing around with large language models, AI agents, and whatever the hype is this week.

From cool ideas to cursed prompts — this repo is where I throw everything LLM-related.

---

## 🤖 What's Inside?

- 🛠️ Mini projects using local models (LLaMA, Mistral, etc.)
- 🧪 Prompt engineering & jailbreak attempts (for science)
- 📚 PDF Q&A tools, chatbots, and AI-powered workflows
- ⚡ Terminal agents, script runners, and memory hacks
- 🐍 Ollama + Python magic
- 🔥 Basically: AI tools I actually *use*, not just “hello world” demos

---

## 🧬 Why?

Because messing with LLMs is the closest we’ve got to magic right now.  
I’m here to build weird tools, automate boring stuff, and maybe replace myself someday.

## 🧰 Tools I Use

- Ollama (for local LLMs)
- Python + LangChain
- LLaMA 3 / Mistral / TinyLlama / Phi
- FastAPI (if serving)
- PyMuPDF / pdfminer / Tesseract (for PDFs)
